Whatever I get to do during my two-week christmas holiday

There's nothing more to say considering this isn't even a project. It's just gonna be every piece of code I write during these 2 weeks.
Those pieces of code may include XSI semaphores, basic PHP, unix system calls implemented in C(write, read, etc) and maybe a bit of Java.
